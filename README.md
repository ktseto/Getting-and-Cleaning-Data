# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

The script run_analysis.R performs a number of operations on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data 
Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The source data is from:

These are the operations performed by the script:  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

The output is a tidy data set, tidy.txt.

See CodeBook.md for a more detailed description of the data sets and run_analysis.R.
